# "Tag" some projects as key projects and show them in a custom perspective

**Idea:** select a few key projects to focus on and create a custom “Key Projects” perspective to display only those. You may want to focus on few projects for a month or a week.

**Solution:** currently, there isn’t a straightforward method to achieve this with custom perspectives. However, another user suggested an interesting workaround: adding an emoji to the project name and then filtering projects by searching for that emoji. This script automates the process of toggling the emoji from a project name, making it easy to manage your key projects. It also works with multiple projects selected.

**Minor glitch:** It appears that OF has a bug where when you toggle on a key project, the custom perspective won't show the tasks of that perspective, while if you restart the program they will appear. I have reported this issue to the company, hopefully, if a bug, will be fixed soon.
